## So what is JavaScript, and what can you do with it?

JavaScript is a programming language. We can use it on the client-side (front-end) for making your HTML and CSS come alive, add logic to your website such as fetching data & using it to display something on the screen, animations, and more. We can also use JavaScript on the server-side (back-end) using NodeJS for serving our website files, Building a REST API with functions to handle any endpoint, connecting to our database, and much more.

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages out there, it can be a lot of fun, and it can be confusing at times. When I first started learning how JS works and how to use it, It was a great challenge.
I am here to help you understand JS the way I see it, and hopefully, it will make your lives a lot easier.
