# The Way I See JavaScript

### My way of understanding and explaining the JavaScript programming language. We start with the basic things, and move to more advanced JS as we go.

I have been learning JS for almost a year now. In the beginning, it was hard to wrap my head around it, but now I feel I can help others understand it better. I hope this project will help others with this incredible programming language, and the opportunities it opens in the programming world!.
I will try and update with new content and learning material as often as I can.
